                Shelf is a Neobank for Young Professionals in India providing services that would help you save as you
                go on spending.
                It also has an electronic ledger system that lets you pay together with other users by creating a shared
                ledger known as
                a Pool. Our Beta app will include but not be limited to pertinent features such as advanced pooling and
                pay-out which
                allows users to make an anticipatory shared ledger, or a Pool, define and pay the said Pool well in
                advance. The Shelf
                "Terms of Use" is an electronic record as defined by the Information Technology Act of 2000, and are
                created by a
                computer system without the use of physical or digital signatures.

                This document is produced in compliance with Rule 3 of the Information Technology (Intermediaries
                Guidelines) Rules,
                2011, which mandates that the Platform undertake due diligence. Before accessing, downloading, or using
                the 'Shelf'
                Platform, please read the Terms and Conditions carefully. By using Shelf's services, you agree to be
                bound by the
                following terms and conditions. Users shall agree to all the clauses stated in this document (including
                the Privacy
                Policy) when they agree to the Terms of Use and this shall be binding on users once agreed to (under the
                laws of the
                Republic of India). If any part of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that
                provision shall be
                assumed to be supplanted by a legally enforceable provision that closely reflects the original
                agreement's meaning, and
                all other sections of the agreement shall be enforced. Users also affirm that the failure on behalf of
                Shelf to exercise
                or enforce any part of this agreement and terms does not constitute a waiver of the rights or provisions
                of this
                agreement.
